# Flow Control Challenge 🚀

This project was developed as part of the **Java Basics Track** offered by **DIO (Digital Innovation One)** in partnership with **Santander**.  
The goal of this challenge is to practice **flow control** using structures such as `if`, `for`, and exception handling with `try/catch`.

## 📚 Challenge Description

The system prompts the user to input two integers via the terminal. Based on these numbers, it performs the following:

- A **validation** step: if the first number is **greater** than the second, a custom exception (`ParametrosInvalidosException`) is thrown.
- If the parameters are valid, the program performs a count based on the difference between the numbers and prints messages like: Printing number 1
Printing number 2
### 🔁 Example:

Input:
Enter the first parameter: 5
Enter the second parameter: 10

Output:
Printing number 1
Printing number 2
Printing number 3
Printing number 4
Printing number 5

If the user enters `10` as the first parameter and `5` as the second, the system throws the exception:
